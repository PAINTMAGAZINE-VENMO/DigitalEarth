I'm sitting on the BalkonEuropas, where currently hundreds of busy and 
ProBab'ly lousy paid workers are working hard to remove the remains of
the FressBude'n and CocktailBar's of the annual StadtFest in the 
CityOfDresden, which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors.

My current ConTract with GlobalFoundries lasts for four months
and it is time to ReView my MasterPlan to ascend VomTellerwaescherZumMillionaer.
(FromDishwasherToMillionaire - watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHN5wO21KZQ).

During my ReSearch on ComputerScience and ConcurrentEngineering
at TuDresden (AnnoDomini1995 to AnnoDomini2001) the VirtualEnterprise was 
one of the hot items in the BuzzwordBingo EsprIt proposals.
(And with the help of artful PowerPointKaraoke by ZigaTurk we won millions of Taxpayers  EuRo's for our really advanced ReSearch projects ;))

Over the next months the groundwork of my TraumFirma will be built.
AnnoDomini2010 i worked for several weeks with PhilipRosedale and his
new StartUp "LoveMachine" which is an amazing RoleModel for my own RoadMap.

On 2010-11-01 (please notice that you entered
a realm that is ruled by fanatic FanOfIso8601 who strictly follow the globally SimpleDateFormat "yyyy-MM-dd") my
serendipious headjump into the SemiConductor industry began.
It is one of the most "KnowledgeIntensive" (quote by IbrahimAjami)
fields of human craft you can imagine.

Unfortunately the industry is still dominated by a cruel CommandAndControl culture.
An entire continent is throwing of it's political elite,
StockMarket's are going crazy and even the StreetsOfLondon are burning.
It is the right time to not only rethink, but the entire foundations
of the coming HyperConnect'ed WorldSociety.
ComPlex'ity ExCel'lence (but without MsOffice)

My EeepiGon is the "cheapest TuringMachine with reasonable KeyBoard Money can buy" and costed 239 EuRo at MediaMarkt. My SurfStick with a SimCard from AldiTalk gives me a PrePaid tariff for entire DeutschLand for 8 EuRo per month.
With GoogleAppEngine and WebEditor we can develop an EcoSystem for mobile WebApp's of almost limitless scalability and a fair pricing model.
The TraumFirma is about real money, real MarketCap and real ShareHolder.
A VirtualEnterprise build from scratch, with an initial InVest'ment of less than 300 EuRo.
