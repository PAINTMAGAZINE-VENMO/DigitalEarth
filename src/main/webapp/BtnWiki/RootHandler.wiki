A special RequestHandler that handles an incoming
HttpServletRequest of a FloatingBoats WebApp and delegates it to another RequestHandler.

In the RecentEdits of the WebEditor you will find
it under "/`*`" - therefore we also may call it the "SlashStar".

For the current RootHandler see https://bigtablenomic.appspot.com/edit?filter=/*
