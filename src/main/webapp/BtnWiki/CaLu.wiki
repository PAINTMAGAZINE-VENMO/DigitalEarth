Some meta-thoughts about the performance:
How to shape the role of RaWa? Is it also an incidental call for him?
Better: no. So he might be shaped as a purposeful "HistoryHacker".

So the formal setting seems to have the structure of the actors forming a MatryoshkaDoll where TheFuture conquers ThePast.
