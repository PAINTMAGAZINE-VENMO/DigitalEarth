On average, there is a tectonic shift in global communication patterns from OneToOne to OneToMany.
And the "many" is growing from SmallToBig.
Some people still act under the wrong assumption of a "closed" "many". But the average resonance of communication is continuously growing.
So there is a ConVerg-ence on the horizon:
In a few years "OneToPublic" will be the DeFault setting for the majority of communication.

And since communication is always a ReferentialAct, the vectors of the KommUnion'icated ConTent point to a new SingularCentre: The NooSphere.
