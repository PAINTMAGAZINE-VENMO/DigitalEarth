What's different from FaceBook?
 * there is no privacy. It's all public.
 * You can delete stuff, but it will remain as an old ReVision
 * There are no groups , only WikiPage's.
 * There is no LikeButton.
 * There are Rules 
 * You can be excluded,
 * It's by invitation only.
 * The NewsFeed is called RecentChanges
 * It's all CamelCase.
