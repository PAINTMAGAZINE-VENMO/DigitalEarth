Think of this as a personal WikiPedia, but additionally MachineReadable.
There are many ongoing ProJect's in this direction like OpenCyc DbPedia WikiData or FreeBase.
We use a SemanticWiki that creates a LinkLanguage, where each HyperLink ConNect's to a ConCept or more generally a MindPattern.
The LinkLanguage can be used inside our RealTime BrowserChat.
Additionally we create various BoardGame's, where SpatialReasoning and ActionPlanning comes into focus.
