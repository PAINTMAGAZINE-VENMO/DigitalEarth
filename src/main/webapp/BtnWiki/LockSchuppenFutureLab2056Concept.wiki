Wie unterscheiden Sie sich von Ihrer Konkurrenz? // What is your difference to the competition?

The main difference to other hot spots in similar fields is the multi-disciplinary social network that has been built up over the last ten years of both founders. Not bounded to local places and clients but outreaching to where the knowledge of collaborative environments and team
entrepreneurship can be of help and a leverage point to generate long-lasting economic benefit for clients, communities, and whole regions.

Leveraging the flow of data, information, and knowledge inside and across organizations through use of wise use of new communication technologies and focusing on the impact of exponential changes we right in is what makes us different to other organizations in similar areas. Collaborating with them in order to complementary increase the positive impact on the involved parties and as a side-effect generate revenue for all participating parties.

Promotion
Wie wollen Sie die Aufmerksamkeit Ihrer Kunden erreichen?
Welche Marketinginstrumente nutzen Sie?

Use of social media. In various ways, either direct communication, web-based workshops, and active visibility in communities. Contacting will happen online and in the real world, such as on conferences, meetings, Meetups, ...!
Personal conversation on small basis and spreading the word of mouth is one of the main sources of marketing. There is no planned campaign that brings all activities into a fixed and planned marketing campaign - other as one would expect.!

Placement
Wie ist Ihr VerTrieb organisiert?
Welche Vertriebswege und -partner wollen Sie nutzen?

Personal trust network, based on initiating small projects from which then to built up to larger cooperations across countries and interdisciplinary fields - this will be a true challenge of the future as all professions do have quite different cultures. What is for one not open and transparent enough could be for another (especially tech startups) already too open and fuzzy. Finding the right level of trust and emotional connectivity is fulfilled by personal conversations and meeting, sharing openly relevant knowledge via the different networks, that are fixed to FaceBook, TwittEr, LinkedIn, or XingLe. They extent in various subnetworks (e.g. http://about.me/RalfLippold)
