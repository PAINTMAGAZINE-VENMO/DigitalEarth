This is an intro to BigTableNomic for people familiar with TwitterNomic:

First, what's similar:
 * It has a set of rules that can be edited by the players
 * a WebBrowser is almost anything you need

What's different:
 * There is no goal for "winning" BigTableNomic
 * The goal of BigTableNomic is to create an InfiniteGame (as FiniteAndInfiniteGames by JamesCarse).
 * There is nothing like a "move". You can do an unlimited number of actions almost at any time.
 * we try to keep the interference with physical boundaries as minimal as possible (currently with RainerWasserfuhr as SysAdmin, and additionally also de facto: GoogleInc as the operator of the physical InfraStructure)
 * with the idea of an InfiniteGame in mind, 


New variants of BigTableNomic might be forked at any time.
