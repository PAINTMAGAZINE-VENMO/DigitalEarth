FabVille is a NextGeneration SocialGame for FloatingBoats.

The MasterPlan for FabVille: In a virtual CleanRoom you can
collaborativly learn about SemiConductor technologies.
You will produce ChipWafer's with the help of FabTool's.

As a result you get a VirtualGood that you can sell in the MindShop of our MicroNation NooPolis.

The fabrication process will be InspiredBy the SmflWiki and MeadConway,
the seminal TextBook on SemiConductor and VlSi.
