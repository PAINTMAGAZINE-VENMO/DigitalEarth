As JohnRobb already diagnosed in HollowStatesAndCrisisOfCapitalism we are now experiencing the "HollowState" all around PlanetEarth.

Over the next 2-4 years we might see a total collapse of the NationState as we know it ToDay.

The NationState will have to reinvent itself as a service provider.

The new InfraStructure will be centered around capital intensive HighTech
clusters like the SemiConductor industry.
CitiZens will be able to choose among competing global networks
that have to start to UnderStand themselves as competitive players
for a HyperConnected global NetWork of KnowledgeWorker's and EarlyAdopter's.

With "GlobalNations" we will early on occupy this new SocialField.

This is a ConCept'ual and experimental field that should play out in the range of a decade. The hot questions: Will it play out in the digital sphere? How will it be positioned in the range between NonProfit (WikiPedia-style) and ForProfit (FaceBook-style) ProJect's?
