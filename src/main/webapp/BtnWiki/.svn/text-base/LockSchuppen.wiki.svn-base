 * RaLi: What do you think about TheFuture of LockSchuppenAg?
 * RaWa: Over the last months I have worked very intensively on enabling tools that could help us to bring us closer to our goal. Think about it as a "SecondLife for SmartPhone", however in the beginning with a reduced "2,5D"- isometric BoardGame, and with focus on purposeful interaction and education.
creating a digital EcoSystem of developers, designers, users, activists.
One first educational application could be "FabVille", which borrows from well know GameDesign approaches like FarmVille, but applied it to the very KnowledgeIntensive field on how to operate a SemiConductor ChipFab.
 * LearningByTeaching. Now I would dare to extend this ParaDigm inventing, designing, developing and playing games.
 * Conclusion: We need a place. at a LockOffice or CoOrpheum. Now I think we have the tools at hand to shift it. E.g. IbmCorp already did this inside SecondLife.
