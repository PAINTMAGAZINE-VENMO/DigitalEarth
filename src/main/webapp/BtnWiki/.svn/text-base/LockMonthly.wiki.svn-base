The **LockMonthly** is a WikiBased meeting of ShareHolder and supporters of LockSchuppenAg.

From the beginning of LockSchuppenAg we have claimed that TelePresence
as a VirtualEnterprise without OfficeSpace is TheFuture.
JimmyWales showed how hundreds of thousands of people can create 
the WorLd's largest encyclopedia, with almost no physical FaceToFace interactions, but only using a WiKi.
And meanwhile we have much better tools like PodCast's ScreenCast's or our LiveWiki.
Can we proof that? To do this we have anything in place:
 * a WiKi
 * people who want to participate, earn money, become ShareHolder or EntrePreneur.

The LockMonthly works similar to WikiMail: On the WikiTable's of WikiPage the participants add the PageName of important HotTopics. Those who have read it (or commented if necessary) add their the "ReadBy" column:

|| *Topic*|| *by*|| *ReadBy*||
||SingularDresden||RaWa||you?||
||ShowRoom||RaWa||you?||
