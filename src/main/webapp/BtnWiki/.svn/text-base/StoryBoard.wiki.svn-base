BigTableNomic is intimately tied to a story that will
drive TheFuture of the game.

Since the creator of BigTableNomic once lived,
there is a miracolous virtual bank called
PieschenBank. Also the WebSite of the PieschenBank 
is based on a BigTableNomic WebApp.

As you can see at the PieschenBank there are four mayor player:
 * SingularAcademy (~ 2_700_000)
 * LockSchuppenAg (~ 900_000)
 * MindBroker (~ 800_000)
 * FamilienFreund (~ 200_000)

Each BankAccount stands for (teams of) people who want to bring forward
NooPolis. Unless you are able to sell your own goods, 
you should get into ConTact with representatives of these 
EnterPrise's and organisations, study their ShareHolder structure
and understand their budgeting processes.
