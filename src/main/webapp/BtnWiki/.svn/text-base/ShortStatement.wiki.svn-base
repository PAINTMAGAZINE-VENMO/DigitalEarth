...

Who, in 200X, is on a way in questions about the future and ignores the concept of the TechnologicalSingularity, by lack of knowledge or strategy, whether consciously or unconsciously, is only on the road for short-term promotional group interests.

Conversely: Who is on the road for promotional or short-term group interests, must give a rationalizing (not rational) rejection to this ConCept by which justification whatsoever.

Who understands this concept and its active and passive probability and rejects it must explain why he considers a world unchanged, or even desirable with:
* PeakOil
* global concentration of wealth through technology
* ClimateCatastrophe
* Aging for each
* Trans Human rich ghettos
* ...

All others enter consciously and actively a phase of transition of humanity.
