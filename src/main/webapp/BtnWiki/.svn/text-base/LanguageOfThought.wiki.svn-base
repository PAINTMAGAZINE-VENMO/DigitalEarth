The SingularAcademy is driven by the central question, how HuMan and MachineIntelligence will ConVerg'e over the coming two decades and how will we win LongBetOne?
We start ToDay under the premise "If you can't MeasureIt, you can't improve it" (PetersLaws).
From AprilFirst of AnnoDomino2012 we started to count the ThoughtsPerSecond of our DigitalTwin.

We MeasureIt and PreDict ThoughtsPerSecond by a SemanticSixSigma ProCess on the *SingularRoadMap*.

To AcCelerate ProGress for the required data and technologies, this requires an IntrinsicMotivation and a SkillSet. So just DoIt.

The most important learning is to DiFer between a »word« and a »thought« to create our LanguageOfThought. So we use CamelCase.
