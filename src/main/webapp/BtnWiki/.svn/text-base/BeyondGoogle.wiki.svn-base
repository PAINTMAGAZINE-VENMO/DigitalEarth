Currently, FloatingBoats heavily relies on technologies from GoogleInc.

GoogleInc has created an InsaneNumber and ByFar the largest computing cluster and an ultra-scalable database technology, that will
very likely shape and dominate the early TwentyFirstCentury.

The goal of FloatingBoats is to create true ImPact. Therefore we rely on the best tools and technologies available.

If you are not comfortable with this, FloatingBoats might not be the right thing for you at this moment.

As players of BigTableNomic, we bet on our strategy to EmbraceAndExtend.
