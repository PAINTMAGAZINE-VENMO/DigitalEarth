SemanticSixSigma is the application of SixSigma principles to SemanticWeb technologies (especially SemanticEnterprise and SemanticWiki)

It measures TripleSpace correctness and completeness and targets ZeroDefects in the NooSphere.

In a SemanticSixSigma ProCess you start with PerSon's who create and 
edit StateMent's.

Each PerSon is represented himself/herself inside the TripleSpace.

_Example: RainerWasserfuhr: https://www.slideshare.net/rainer/goodbyekurzweil/50 _

Each statement is repeatedly ReView'ed with a "True" or "False" result
(InspiredBy TestDrivenDevelopment)

Each change and ReView is auditably recorded on a SixSigmaTime axis.

A SemanticSixSigma Process has a well defined LeaderShip.

SemanticSixSigma is the foundation for the SingularRoadMap.
