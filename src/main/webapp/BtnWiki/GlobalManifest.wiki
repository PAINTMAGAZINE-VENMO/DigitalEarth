All these PieschenBrand items are the first building blocks of 
a new WorLd.

It is nothing less than turning PlanetEarth
into a MassiveMultiUserAugmentedRealityGame
with sophisticated game mechanics.
It is the implementation of FriedrichSchiller
seminal ... 
"Der Mensch spielt nur, wo er in voller Bedeutung des Wortes Mensch ist, und er ist nur da ganz Mensch, wo er spielt."

You can imagine that this approach will provoke armies of naysayers.
you will not reach the next level, if you don't overcome them.
Fight them: Create alliances 

Challenge existing authorities. Dont fear them. They are naked.

As UmairHaque would say: Don't let's create yet another MindLess game
 inside the ZombiConomy (like IbrahimEvsan's FlipLife).

This is not enough. We want to bet on the TransForm'ative power of games.

We don't want borders of NationState's.

We want to own the tanks and supercarrier's of the WorLd's most powerful armies.
We want to edit the WorLd's RealEstate properties on OpenStreetMap.
We want TransParent hospitals, where we can see who needs the most urgent help.
We want to see each PayMent on each BankAccount of BankOfAmerica.
We want the old dirt of centuries turned into BlockBuster stories tears anger and plots.
We want to see leaked each SecretServiceWiki.

We are the NuclearPowerStation of the NooSphere.
