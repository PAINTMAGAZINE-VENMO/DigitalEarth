Is a machine too "mechanical" to simulate a HumanBrain?

The cells in our body follow the laws biochemistry,
newtonian mechanics and maybe quantum mechanics.
So mechanical vs non-mechanical ("natural?") does
not make much sense. It might be better to DiFer'entiate between ComPlex'ity.
Whilst evolution needed millions of years to create these astonishing results, we now have a new layer that only took centuries or decades and is AcCelerate'ing in it's ProGress.

It was "designed" by evolution. Unfortunatly, it isnt too IntelLigent, because it didn't reveal it's entire BluePrint yet.

We need a MiNd-DeBugger.
