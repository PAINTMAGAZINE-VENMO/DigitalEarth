TrueMan left the HauptStaedtchen on 2011-02-02 with EasyJet.
He spent less than 200 EuRo to travel to the StadtBerlin,
fly to Genf and Hurghada and finally take the bus to AlQahira.

He had a mission. For years he had worked on his MicroNation
to create the next generation society.

Now there was a NationState collapsing.

With all the wonderful tools available he started
a CrashCource to study this social ensemble.

He had to figure out the role of MohamedElBaradei.

There were best people in his mind:
 * DavidOrban
 * JohnRobb
 * PatriFriedman
 * PhilipRosedale

The first barrier was, how to bring his ideas into
the MainStream media. It could be perceived as a "GeekNation"
or "SocialIsm".
