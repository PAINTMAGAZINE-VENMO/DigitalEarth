I myself have not even console games. At the age of 16 or 17 I played myself a month of SimCity firmly. After that I wrote with permanent marker "This is not a computer game" to the monitor from the PersonalComputer. When this monitor later emigrated to the rehearsal room, SomeBody wrote a "Yes" next to it and it was again, installed two games on it. Well, it was no longer my own somehow.
Really irritated me, but then the games have not yet. Before that, the CommodoreSixtyFour saw that something different. Since there was ManiacMansion, DayOfTheTentacle, and before that I was even a adventure exciting, where you had to explain as a detective on a paddle steamer murder. Immerse themselves in worlds or spaces, or even to create space, place and I always find a lot more interesting than, say to each other in terms of speed or skill to be measured. Clearly, if I do not win, you lose the charm for me. I designed a world, however, is individual and if the game is well designed, I can find it. I even know someone who cares for this kind of relationship with other people. People he has previously met so and so live out a TransMedia PenPal.
I'm not the only one who finds this kind of games more interesting, you could also see recently in a spectacular CrowdFunding campaign. ClaudiaPelzer writes in crowdsourcing WebLog:
Comparatively modest $ 400,000 game developer TimSchafer for his new computer game had to KickStarter. A day later, the community, the project had been blown up to a million. And so far does not seem to be closing - currently (as of February 10, 17.30 clock) are already over 1.3 million and the maturity is 32 days. This is already a KickStarter for a new platform of record [...].
The project is a throwback to the point and click PC adventure-90s.
In the end, there were nearly 90,000 supporters, who together brought together a total of over 3 million U.S. $.
Another exciting game is the JourneyGame, the network reporter on DeRadio know the game was introduced.
In JourneyGame almost everything is different than usual. There is no high score, health bars or even a game manual. The user decides to search for his way through the endless desert and sand washed over the ruins of a lost civilization. Without text and dialogues the JourneyGame unfolds it's story. Mysterious dream sequences that are reminiscent of the cosmological murals Hobi open up a WorLd of hints. That Games Company to expand the emotional range of video games. Journey into the user glides over sand in changing lighting moods. Explored underground building, rises up in mighty towers, feel awe, wonder, wonder, my friends. Large Vokablen that seem otherwise reserved for literature or art.
[...]
In the online mode JourneyGame goes other ways. Sometimes you meet a single other online player. Then there is no nonsense and funny nicknames in the chat window. The chance encounter remains nameless and without words. Only you can give each other notes with phonetic symbols. One can show each other the way or simply to accompany a piece. Wordless communication, intense and almost intimate.
JourneyGame seems entirely to words than to do without language, yet, or perhaps not least because it is considered "one of the best indie ComputerGame's of our time."
Can create emotions and stories that tell themselves every experience.
It is therefore very aware of the capabilities of designing human recourse, emotions are our individual brush strokes. Very probably this is also a distinguishing feature compared to 10 or 20 years ago. Very well, I see this as a reason why aesthetic and cultural education now occupies a much larger role. The "DoItYourself" is a feature of our time. Not only emotionally, aesthetically, but also ConCept'ually. We set up our own information filters to deal with the real flood of information can already. The evening news and newspapers are now only possible filters of many, though still with a greater significance. But long to get there very well without MassMedia, and no less clearly informed.
Since it is just serving, I would like once again to bow to the "cultural heart attack" include and emphasize that the preservation, maintenance and exploration of cultural heritage and contemporary history, the basis for the work of cultural institutions, it is based more than ever is about that the participants can classify these facilities in the cultural space in the WorLd and find belonging, as he gets the chance to tell themselves to make themselves and thus to experience himself.
