While his maedchen was shopping for shoes at DeichMann, he explored the nearby shops
and ran into the GameStop shop. He watched a little boy of 8 or 10 years playing soccer on an ExBox360. He remembered the InternationalSoccer game on his CommodoreSixtyFour.
He asked the boy about resolution of this game.
