like a ChatBot, but for commenting on WebLog's.

Nice UseCase for ArTelligence:

Crawl content from a list of WebLog's.

Do the WebLog-authors have to OptIn before a crawler can be sent?

How good does the BlogBot have to be?

Can we define metrics (e.g. percentage of replied comments, % of deleted comments)?
