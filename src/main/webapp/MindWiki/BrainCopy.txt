Let's assume a scenario where we will have technology to perfectly copy our
entire brain. [This|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C4roIvvvwE#t=8m28s] might give us an idea.

Let's further assume tremendous ProGress in neurosciences.
We will be able to understand the entire causality of our ConScious'ness:
Whenever we think of »HalleBerry«, we will know her neural correlates in our MiNd.
We will even be able to change the color of her swimsuit in DieAnotherDay: Yes: It was blue.
And you always only saw her with a blue swimsuit.
