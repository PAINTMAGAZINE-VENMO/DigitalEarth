Like GoogleEarth, but for zooming down into your own brain.

With GoogleMind, you can see the NeuroActivation in your CorticalColumn's.

Imagine your first NeuroScanner: You can ZoOm down.
You can see how the spikes spread across your brain.
You can do certain things, while checking how your neurons react.
You can look at a picture of HalleBerry and find out which neurons will fire for the HalleBerryPattern.
You can rewire them. You can see your "fear" reaction while looking at
a spider. And you can change it. You can walk through your memories.
You can rearrange them on an exact TimeLine.
