Since NooPolis wants to build it's own legal system, we have to define
the boundaries to existing legal systems.

The critical situation will be, when one of CitiZens tries to enforce
legal rule concerning NooPolis without using the MindCourt.

Some ForeignLaw's that may apply due to the multiple citizenship of the ImPrint holder RainerWasserfuhr:
* ยง 5 Telemediengesetz 
* ยง 55 Rundfunkstaatsvertrag

Many other laws may apply
* [DeWikiPedia:Kreditwesengesetz]
* [DeWikiPedia:Markenrecht]
* [DeWikiPedia:Jugendschutz]
* ...

One of the basic ideas of NooPolis is to __forget__ about any existing rules and laws
and start a rule system from scratch as free agreement of the CitiZens, based on the ConStituion.
