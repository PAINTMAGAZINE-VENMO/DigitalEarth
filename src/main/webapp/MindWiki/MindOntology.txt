* InterWiki: [OpenCog:MindOntology]

The LongTerm goal of MindBroker is to build a ThinkingMachine,
that helps RayKurzweil to win LongBetOne UnTil2029.
For growing in this direction, we develop a DomainModel,
that clearly DeFin'es and formalizes our foundamental (sic!) ConCept's.
It will be the basis for the implementation of the MindMachine on top of NoOs.


When DeFin'ing the basic term (UrObjekt) of our DomainModel, we have to choose carefully
from a broad range of PriorArt alternatives, e.g. ObjectOrientedDesign SemanticWeb TopicMaps or NeuroScience.
OpenCog OntoLogy:

In order to distinguish the mental representations from
the different terms of NaturalLanguage, we introduce 
the basic ConCept of a »MindPattern«.
Similar ConCept's could be "Entity" "ObJect" "Thing" or "Topic".

We use the more generic term »MindPattern« to emphasize that it may also 
cover actions or behavioural pattern.
We want to create a ProCess for continuous SupervisedLearning of MindPattern.
Our BabyAi will be like a digital toddler, tought by user interaction.  
We plan to use the vast amounts of SemanticWeb data, that
is currently growing around the LinkedData communities.

A MindPattern can be learned by interacting with the outside WorLd or deduced from own thoughts.

Many MindPattern have a name.

For our first steps we DeFin'e a basic MindNameSpace, that
will be managed by the MindWiki, which has a UniqueNameAssumption for it's PageIndex.

So for example, most HuMan's will be able to recognise
28910 28911 or 29912 as numbers.
However, only for owners or fans of the CommodoreSixtyFour will
know that reminds them of the fmous "28911 bytes free". So in some MiNd's,
this causes an activation of CommodoreSixtyFour.

Each MindPattern is ConNect'ed to zero or more other MindPattern's.
Currently they are represented as CamelCase and they define
a graph of BackLink's for each WikiPage.

You are invited to JoinNow and become part of this LongTerm
journey.

Your first action when you interact with
the BabyAi will be to choose your name
under which you can be uniquely identified in TheFuture.
We have a strict RealName convention at MindBroker.
We are accustomed to work in the public sphere
and the the mode of PerpetualBeta.
