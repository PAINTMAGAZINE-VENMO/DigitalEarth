Founding Meeting for Singularity University
via Dharmendra S Modha's Cognitive Computing Blog von dsmodha am 21.09.08

On September 20, 2008, I was invited by Ray Kurzweil (Co-founder, Kurzweil Technologies),
Peter Diamandis (Chairman/CEO X PRIZE Foundation), and Dr. Pete Worden (Director, NASA 
Ames Research Center) to attend a discussion on possible creation of Singularity University 
at NASA Ames.

The meeting was beautifully organized and run. Ray Kurzweil made an amazing presentation. 
I also made a presentation on Cognitive Computing. Larry Page said that he evaluates projects 
on a simple binary metric: "whether, if successful, it can change the world?" Bob Richards 
said that in any educational endeavor "peole are the product".

I had a chance to meet and discuss with Larry Page (Founder, Google), Nobelist George Smoot 
(Lawrence Berkeley National Lab), Larry Smarr (Founding Director of the California Institute 
for Telecommunications and Information Technology at UCSD), Tim Draper (VC, Draper Fisher 
Jurvetson), Stephanie Langhoff (Chief Scientist, NASA Ames), Ralph Merkle (Institute for 
Molecular Manufacturing), Michael Simpson (President, International Space University), Bob 
Richards (Founder & CEO, Odyssey Moon), Moses Znaimer (ideaCity), Ramez Naam (Microsoft), 
and many other distinguished people in different spheres of science, technology, business, 
art, and media.

All in all, a weekend day well spent in company of brilliant and sincere people trying to 
make a positive impact on the world! As an added bonus, I ran into an old high school friend, 
Deep Nishar (Director of Wireless Products at Google).
