TheExperiment showed: The [AgiriWiki:Memory] has to be very fluent. Of course there is some "absolute" time axis, which is focused around a standard model of time like [WikiWikiWeb:UnixTime].
Many sources of time related information have contexts with time zones and systematic time clock errors, e.g. from time series of devices. [WikiWikiWeb:DaylightSavingTime] will produce a systematic error bias.
The most important sources for memory:
* WikiPage's of the MindWiki, including revisions from RecentChanges
* WikiLender and WasWar
* timestamps from the DataMap (mainly DelIcioUs, TwittEr, FlickEr, XingLe-InBox)
* timestamps from WebApp's
* WikiPedia (almost only events with a precision of one day; exact location and time must be InFer'ed from context)
