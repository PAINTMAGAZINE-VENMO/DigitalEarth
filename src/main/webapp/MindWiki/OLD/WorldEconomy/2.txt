An OptimisticThoughtExperiment: Imagine the best MiNd's on PlanetEarth coming together in
a council of the UnitedNations to reinvent the WorldEconomy with a new currency, solely
based on the idea of a global WebOfTrust. It will be:
* completely digital
* completely transparent
* based on a world ConStitution
* have the simplest and most efficient tax system ever
* governed by a world CabiNet
* replacing existing currencies within a 20-year RoadMap

Another GedankenSpiel:
Image an extraterrestrial ConScoius being just arriving from outer space.
What would be the DiFer'ent fundamental concepts used to describe the WorldEconomy?
ForbesList, BigCo, WechselKurs...?
