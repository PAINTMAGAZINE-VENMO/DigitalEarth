An idea for a TuringTest contest similar to the [Rules|http://loebner.net/Prizef/2007_Contest/Rules.html] of the LoebnerPrize:
* Contestants can apply to participate in the TwitAiPrize
* Contestants must be CitiZens of NooPolis
* The CabiNet of NooPolis nominates the Final Four entrants from the contestants
* The CabiNet of NooPolis nominates 4 Judges
* The CabiNet of NooPolis nominates 8 MindTurk's who have TwittEr accounts.
* The CabiNet chooses per ZuFall... TBD
* Judges will have 25 minutes to interact with each pair of entities.
* Interaction is via TwittEr
