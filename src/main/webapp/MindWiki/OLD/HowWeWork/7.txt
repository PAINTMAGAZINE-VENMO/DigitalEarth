MindBroker is a VirtualEnterprise, which operates mainly WikiBased. Our Wiki, the MindWiki, is the focus of our work. 
Our main project is NooPolis, a complex WikiBased simulation of a virtual republic and economy. Therefore, we consider our coworkers, customers and suppliers as CitiZens of the MicroNation NooPolis. Each of them receives an invitation for a MindId with a LogIn which allows them to edit the wiki.
