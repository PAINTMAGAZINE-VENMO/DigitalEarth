* Mind Quote: "This company is built on Wikis" - ShashiSeth, Product Manager, Search Quality, GoogleInc; at WikiSym 2005, SanDiego. 

MindBroker is a virtual company, which operates mainly wiki based. Our Wiki, WikiMind, is the focus of our work. 
Our main product is NooPolis, a complex wiki based simulation of a virtual republic and economy. Consequently, we consider our coworkers, customers and suppliers as CitiZens of NooPolis. Each of them receives an invitation for a MindId with a login that allows them to edit the wiki.
