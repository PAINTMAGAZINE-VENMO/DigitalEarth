EigenMuster are the core of NewMind.

Let's do the math: 100b neurons with avg 1000 synaptic connections each.

Somewhere deep inside this haystack there might be a representation of a HalleBerry-pattern,
which fires when you see a woman with certain body properties returning
from a bath in the sea back to the IslandsOfHumanIntelligence as HalleBerry did in DieAnotherDay.

Now lets assume you are a Mind-Body-AvaTar like ReneDescartes suggested.

Inside your mind there are round about 620.000.000.000.000*8bit.

You are on honeymoon. Your just-married TraumPartner is beside you.
You are on the beach, reading a book called SingularityIsNear.
This night you are going to produce a new WunderKind.

Then you raise your head towards the horizon and suddenly you see HallyBerry.

Now describe the state of your EigenMuster.
