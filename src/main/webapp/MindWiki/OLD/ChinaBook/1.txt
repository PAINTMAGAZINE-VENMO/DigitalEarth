my congratulations to Mark Zuckerberg  and HuJintao for their historic agreement called »ChinaBook«, turning the entire People's Republic of China into a SocialNetwork with then 1 330 000 000 MonthlyActiveUsers.
The decision was made possible after the yesterday resolution of the
National People's Congress entitled »GreatLeapForSingularity«.
The renminbi will be replaced by FbCredits.
HuJintao declared that he will resign from his incumbency by the end of this year and that the new ParamountLeader will be elected by counting the "likes" on their FaceBook page.
In an additional diplomatic note, ZyngaInc announced, that they
where granted a 2 billion FbCredits contract for developing
a new FbApp called »RiceVille« to manage the entire
rice production of China. #HistoryOfTheFuture
