MindBroker performs WikiDrivenDevelopment:

* The first prototype of a WebApp is a Wiki.
* User and data are first created as pages in the wiki. They include:
** Users themselves
** Software developers
** The ([WikiWikiWeb:GoldOwner])
* Based on RecentChanges typical and RePeat'ed UseCases are identified and automated
* Ideas for our WebApp's first have a page in the MindWiki.
* The PageIndex is the foundation for the project glossary and the DomainModel.
* Structured daten are first captured in the MindWiki as Wiki-Tables, MindTags or MindProps.
* As soon as a Wiki-Table is edited more frequently, the table columns are used as a first draft of the DomainModel.
* With the DomainModel we develop a WebApp, which replaces the wiki table
* Step by step, routine processes in the MindWiki are simplified and the MindFlow is AcCelerate'd.
* Per MindApi, more and more WebApp's are developed around the MindWiki.
