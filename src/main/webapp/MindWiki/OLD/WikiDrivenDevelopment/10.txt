[inspired|http://riehle.org/computer-science/research/2007/wikis4se-2007-ppaper.html] by DirkRiehle, PeterNorvig's TheorizingFromData and similar to [WikiPedia:Test-driven_development] or [WikiPedia:Model-driven_development]:

MindBroker performs WikiDrivenDevelopment:

* The very first prototype of a WebApp is a WikiPage.
* User and data are first created as WikiPage's in the wiki. They include:
** WikiHomePage's of users themselves
** Software developers
** The [WikiWikiWeb:GoldOwner]
* by RePeat'edly observing RecentChanges, typical UseCase's are identified and successively automated
* The PageIndex is the foundation for the project glossary and the DomainModel.
* Structured data is first captured in the MindWiki as WikiTable's, MindTags or MindProps.
* As soon as a WikiTable is edited more frequently, the table columns are used as a first draft of the DomainModel.
* With the DomainModel we develop a WebApp, which replaces the WikiTable
* Step by step, routine processes in the MindWiki are simplified and the MindFlow is AcCelerate'd.
* via MindApi, more and more WebApp's are developed around the MindWiki.
