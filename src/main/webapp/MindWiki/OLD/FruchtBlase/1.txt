For the RealFilm: Inspired by the [precog|http://images.google.com/images?q=precog]: Human life is augmented by a brain simulation. It feels like perpetual existence in a FruchtBlase. Your mind can play games of "birth" where you can give yourself birth into any parallel numbers of simulation of RealLife. You can choose any TraumZeitAlter you wish. You can always be connected to your main brain. At any time of the simulation you can use a time lapse and choose FastForward. You can even choose to get disconnected from your MainBrain - and try to build your own MainBrain inside your simulation.
