Idea: SubMit to IsWc 2010:

!DcTitle: SemanticMind - A SemanticWeb based personal LifeWiki on the long road towards WholeBrainEmulation ;)

The SemanticMind will be a SemanticWeb based Model of a DigitalTwin of RainerWasserfuhr.

It consists of concrete entities like places, books, ideas, PerSon's or general ConCept's.

It is created from a public LifeWiki started end of 2006 that grew to a PageCount of over 10.000 WikiPage's UnTil january 2010.

This MindPaper describes how the data is created, maintained, embedded into LinkedData and it's possible applications for the TimeToCome.

!The data

The RdF is available as
* MindN3
* MindRdf

The RdF itself is generated via CloJure code inside the MindWiki: RdfClj

The ConTent is created and maintained by a slightly modified JspWiki.

!LinkedData
One of the InterWiki-links to WikiPedia and LifeWiki's WikiWikiWeb of WardCunningham or CommunityWiki.
Since 2009 many PerSon's working as ReSearch'ers in ComputerScience also obtained links to DbLp.



The raw ConTent of the MindWiki is also available for DownLoad as MindZip.

The PageIndex of all WikiPage's is the base for all DeFin'ed ReSource's.
Each WikiPage can be hooked into an OntoLogy via MindProps.
