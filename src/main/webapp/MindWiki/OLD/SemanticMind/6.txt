Idea: SubMit to IsWc 2010:

!DcTitle: SemanticMind - A SemanticWeb based personal LifeWiki on the long road towards WholeBrainEmulation ;)

The SemanticMind will be a SemanticWeb based Model of the personal KnowLedge of RainerWasserfuhr.

It consists of concrete entities like places, books, ideas, PerSon's or general ConCept's.

It is created from a public LifeWiki started end of 2006 that grew to a PageCount of over 10.000 WikiPage's UnTil january 2010.

This MindPaper describes how the data is created, maintained, embedded into LinkedData and possible applications for the TimeToCome.

!A SemanticWiki

The ConTent is created and maintained by a slightly modified JspWiki.
Each ReSource is first created as a WikiPage.

40% of the WikiPage's are sorted into a lightweight OntoLogy with a "SubClassOf"-depth of 1 to 5 levels.

!The data
The RdF is available as
* MindN3
* MindRdf

The RdF itself is generated as NotationThree via CloJure code inside the MindWiki: RdfClj

!LinkedData
One of the InterWiki-links to WikiPedia and LifeWiki's WikiWikiWeb of WardCunningham or CommunityWiki.
Since 2009 many PerSon's working as ReSearch'ers in ComputerScience also obtained DeepLink's to DbLp.

The raw ConTent of the MindWiki is also available for DownLoad as MindZip.

The PageIndex of all WikiPage's is the base for all DeFin'ed ReSource's.
Each WikiPage can be hooked into an OntoLogy via MindProps.
