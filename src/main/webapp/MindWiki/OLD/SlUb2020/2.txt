2 days ago at the OpenCoffeeClubDresden RainerWasserfuhr sat next to AchimBonte, the assistant general director of SlUb, the largest scientific library of germany (measured in book usage).
It has an amazing architecture: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Slub-dresden-reading-room-2.JPG]

Some of the ~1000 desks in the ReadingRoom have "no laptops" signs (30-40%)? On the remaining desks LapTop's are allowed.
it will be an interesting observation how the frontier of the "no laptops" area will move in the coming years.
RainerWasserfuhr spent almost 11h inside the buildung, edited the MindWiki and the WikiPedia article about ExtremeBlue, recorded clips for PieschenTv - and never touched any book.
