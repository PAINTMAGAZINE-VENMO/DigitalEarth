LockSchuppen is going to be a CoWorking space and LearningLab. What that means is LockSchuppen is expanding the idea of a classical BusinessCenter. This space (and the idea of coworking) is built on the following values:

* __CollabOration__: One of the great benefits of working in a coworking space is that you will meet all sorts of people with all sorts of knowledge.

* __OpenNess__: We believe in transparency and openness. In a world where people are free, but ideas are not, only a few benefit. When ideas are free, and shared amongst commmunity everyone benefits. Therefore, we encourage open spaces and dialogue. 

* __CommUnity__: We thrive on connections (also across boundaries and with other communities and CoWorkingSpaces) and mutual support here. It is important that everyone gives into as well as benefit from the arising German  and international CoWorking community.

* __AccessIbility__: Openness implies accessibility,all interested parties are invited to take active part in the community (full-time, part-time or just once in a while).

* __SustainAbility__: Shared spaces located centrally are providing benefit to climate, so we like to take that a little further and make certain our space is very environmentally responsible.

* __CollectiveLearning__: We believe that learning together in community opens whole new opportunity windows for the members and their clients' businesses.

As individual businesses, we also bring our own values into the community and love to share at gatherings around the city where relevant issues are talked about (such as entrenepreneurship, new forms of work, sustainability)
