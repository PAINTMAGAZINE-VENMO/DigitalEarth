today is to express my disappointment, that you have invited this highly sophisticated crackpot, and giving him a natural form to express his pssudo-religious predictions that have no basis in objective reality.

"... If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century. Now, a lot happens in six months. Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster. It's going to continue, and in about 40 years it's going to be moving so fast - the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick - that you won't be able to follow it... unless you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we've created."

if you go back 500 years — not much happend in century. Now a lot happens in 6 months. Technology fits on itself and it gets faster and faster. It's gonna continue in about 40 years it's gonna be moving so fast, the ???? changes gonna be so… Stunnishnelly (?) quick that you won't be able to follow it, unless… you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we've created.

— This guy is freaking! He says computers will have consecness (?) in just 25 years

— If you get to the 2030th you're not to be able to tell the clear difference between human and machine intelligence

— The big questions of life is — «Who are we?», «What are we gonna become?», «What's the future like» and…
He's got one of most incredible (?trackwords? ways?) in history possibility to predict (???) good accuracy.

— He's an award winning scientist and engineer, a millionaire several times over because of his inventions.

[«Ray Kurzweil»]

-These inventions (?laid in up?) causing a worst war the humanities ever had!

Corporations and governments and societies will be crated and destroyed on the back of the technology that this book describes.

— the world is (?flattening?), world is (?..lising?)

— Inventor Ray Kurzweil thinks that one day humans may be able to live forever.

— I want to live just as long as i can, I don't want to die. If following Ray's resurgent would took that day off… I… very wellcome to do that.

— I knew there was a reason I was keeping all this stuff, and he kept all the stuff.

— I do plan to bring back my father.

— God is who he is, and our challenge should be to know him, not try to create him.

[«Afraid of you!»]

— I think it's gonna scare a lot of people!

— The world is changing far too fast. Nothing like this has ever happend to homosapiens before

— These ideas are gonna ultimately change the world

— We didn't stay on the ground, we didn't stay on the planet, we didn't stay with the limitations of our biology

— I think Ray is (????) profit. That's wrong.

— He is used the gift that he was given for the betterment of human kind. That's wat I mean.

It will be the Universe, waking up.
