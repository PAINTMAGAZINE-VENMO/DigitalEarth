For NooPolis, we not only understand VirtualReality as a 3-dimensional simulation or augmentation of the physical reality, but as an (experimental) creation of entirely new levels of reality also in an organizational and institutional way.

We virtualise reality by InVent'ing rules on top of existing reality. The rules create reality games, which reflect the existing reality, but try to cut off their complexities, inefficiencies and ParaDox'es.
