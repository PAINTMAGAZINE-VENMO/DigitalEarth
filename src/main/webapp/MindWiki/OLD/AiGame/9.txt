The goal of the AiGame is to create a friendly ArtificialIntelligence which supports RayKurzweil to win his LongBetOne until 2029.

Inspired by the ReSearch of BenGoertzel, his company NovaMente and the [AgiriWiki:AGISim], the AiGame could create
* a virtual PostReal multiuser world which is inhabited by real people and intelligent agents.
* an SemanticEconomy with it's own currency, a banking system (with learnings from SecondLife), a TradeRegister with virtual EnterPrise's and trading of goods and services.

* Our virtual world: NooPolis
* Our currency: KayGroschen
* Our bank: PieschenBank
* Our UniVerse: NooSphere

All this will be modeled with SemanticWeb technologies, OpenSource software, open APIs and open content.
The activities of humans and intelligent agents will be governed by a virtual EmergentDemocracy with its own ConStitution.
The players are CitiZens of a self-organizing SocialNetwork.
