The goal of the AiGame is to create an platform 
advanced in ArtificialGeneralIntelligence
abe to create a friendly ArtificialIntelligence which might

We are developing a platform where developers and users can create their own DigitalTwin for acting as a ChatBot in a virtual enviroment called SingularTheater.
(initially in 2 dimensional with text chats, later on 3D and as an AugmentedReality)

Inspired by the ReSearch of BenGoertzel, his company NovaMente and the [AgiriWiki:AGISim], the AiGame could create
* a virtual PostReal multiuser world which is inhabited by real people and intelligent agents, interacting with each other like AvaTar's
* a SemanticEconomy with it's own currency, a banking system (with learnings from SecondLife), a TradeRegister with virtual EnterPrise's and trading of goods and services.

* Our virtual world: NooPolis
* Our currency: KayGroschen
* Our bank: PieschenBank
* Our UniVerse: NooSphere

All this is modeled with SemanticWeb technologies, OpenSource software, open APIs and open content.
The activities of humans and intelligent agents are governed by a virtual MicroNation with its own ConStitution.
The players are CitiZens of a self-organizing SocialNetwork.

The goal of the AiGame: pass the WikiTuringTest.

The LongTerm goal of the AiGame is to support RayKurzweil to win his LongBetOne UnTil2029.
