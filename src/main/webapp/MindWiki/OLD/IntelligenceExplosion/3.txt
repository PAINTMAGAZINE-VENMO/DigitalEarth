The IntelligenceExplosion can be seen as a generalization or consequence of MooresLaw
towards the social and cultural change:
The exponential increases in scales of TerraFlops, InterNet traffic and storage capacities

This causes extreme pressures on individual HuMan MiNd's, because their hardware
did not change significantly until the year 2008. In 2008 more and more MindPeople
started to reconfigure their mental basis and applied techniques like MindDoping.
