Some people not familiar with LifeWiki's and the MindWiki report a WikiShock while reading it.

Why WikiShock? What is the barrier to start and create a WikiBased digital SelfModel of our MiNd?

Because of being confronted with
# the ComPlex'ity AND
# the EndLich'keit of our own MiNd?

Because of not thinking about HolyData.

Because huge amounts of data require MedienKompetenz to master them. 

Because of not knowing how to use tools like DelIcioUs, BlogLines, XingLe.

Because of the IdeoLogie of PriVat'eness.

Only a WikiMind is ready for the next ShockLevel: JoinNow: __EinfachMachen__!
