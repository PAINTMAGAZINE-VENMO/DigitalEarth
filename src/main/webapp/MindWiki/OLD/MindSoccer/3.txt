MindSoccer could be an AiGame.

You can use the Java based MindSoccer framework and you have to implement the classes 
* de.mindbroker.soccer.Trainer and
* de.mindbroker.soccer.Player

In the first edition of MindSoccer, kicking is very simple: The Ball is only played on a 2 dimensional level.

each Player has a limited field of perception. (90 degrees - 45 degrees to left and 45 to the right.)
Each second a player can:
* increase or decrease his speed by 3 meter per second (The maximum running speed of a Player is up to 10 meter per second.)
* change orientation
* kick (requires the ball to be close)

Future extensions:
* The trainers of both teams can shout. Trainers can observe the entire field. All players can hear the shoutings of both Trainers.
* substitutions
* limited EnErgie of a player, based on their acceleration and average speed
* 3D
