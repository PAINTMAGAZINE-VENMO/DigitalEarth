like a TuringTest, but WikiBased and as a multi-user experiment:

During the AiGame, players have to create their NewMind. The NewMind is a DigitalTwin of their KopfWelt.
In the beginning, the players act as MechanicalTurk for their NewMind by editing their LifeWiki.
The NewMind's become more and more and complex, and more and more automated.
From time to time, the players have to give up control to a fully automated NewMind.
Other players have to guess whether the NewMind is still operated by their MechanicalTurk.
