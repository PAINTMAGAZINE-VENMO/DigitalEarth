Like GoogleEarth, but for zooming down into your own brain.

With GoogleMind, you can see the activities of your [WikiPedia:Cortical_column]s.

Imagine your first NeuroScanner: You can ZoOm down.
You can see how the spikes spread across your brain.
You can do certain things, while checking how your neurons react.
You can look at a picture of HalleBerry and find out which neurons will fire.
You can rewire them. You can see your "fear" reaction while looking at
a Spider. And you can change it. You can walk through your memories.
You can rearrange them on an exact TimeLine.
