* MindLine: 2030

Like GoogleEarth, but for zooming down into your own brain.

With GoogleMind, you can see the activities of your [WikiPedia:Cortical_column]s.

With GoogleMindPro you can see and edit the activities of single neurons and change the synaptic connections.

GoogleMindPro poses extremely interesting questions towards the philosophy of MiNd:
* How does a MiNd work that is confronted with it's own hardware?
* Which kinds of feedback between hardware and ConScious'ness will occur?
* NotIfButWhen will it be possible to transfer observed states of my wetware to silicon?
* NotIfButWhen will it be possible to AcCelerate the silicon model of my MiNd?
