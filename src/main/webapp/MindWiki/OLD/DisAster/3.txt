* HerKunft: [WikiPedia:Disaster]: "from the Greek pejorative prefix dis- bad + aster star"

On TimeLine:20080215 the main server of our SocialGrid didn't respond to ssh logins.
So RainerWasserfuhr tried to reboot the server, but unfortunately, "ec2-reboot-instances" failed, WernerVogels and ams@amazon.com didn't respond, so a DisAster ReCovery was necessary.

Fortunately, we have SocialBackup, so we only lost:
* the MindId of CitiZens AnjaFrenzel,FrankLorenz+BastianScherbeck.
* 4 days of the RecentChanges
* ~10 payments at the PieschenBank (mainly BegruessungsGeld and LiebesRinge)
* the postings+comments of the MindBlog.
