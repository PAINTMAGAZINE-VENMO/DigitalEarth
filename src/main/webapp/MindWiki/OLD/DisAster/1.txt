On TimeLine:20080215 the main server of our SocialGrid didn't respond to ssh logins.
So RainerWasserfuhr tried to reboot the server, but unfortunately, "ec2-reboot-instances" failed, WernerVogels and ams@amazon.com didn't respond, so a DisAster ReCovery was necessary.

We lost:
* 4 days of the RecentChanges
* ~days of PieschenBank payments
* 2 CitiZens
