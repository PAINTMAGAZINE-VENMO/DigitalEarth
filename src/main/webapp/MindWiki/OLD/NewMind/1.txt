First thoughts and a very first draft of the architecture of a MiNd simulation on top of the MindWiki:

The basic layer consists of a SemanticWeb wrapper around the MindWiki, and a transitive closure of MindTrust-relationships.

The RDF statements are arranged as a causal hierarchy of statements. The engine continuously computes a "root" belief statement, selected from the set of all known resources.
The NewMind has a representation of itself. It can interact with its environment, if external sources make statements about the NewMind.
