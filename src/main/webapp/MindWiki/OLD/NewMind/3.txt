* MindTags: ProJect
* MindLine: 2029

The goal: achieve an immersive simulation of an entire human MiNd until 2029.

First thoughts and a very first draft of the architecture on top of the MindWiki:

The basic layer consists of a SemanticWeb wrapper around the MindWiki, and a transitive closure of MindTrust-relationships.

The RDF statements are arranged as a causal hierarchy of statements. The engine continuously computes a "root" belief statement, selected from the set of all known resources.
The NewMind has a representation of itself. It can interact with its environment, if external sources make statements about the NewMind.

It will have a MindApi to the MindEyes of RainerWasserfuhr.

Modules:
* Goals: DoIt, ReDo, RoadMap
* Perception: MindEyes, MindFeeds
* Embodiment: TerraMind
* Memory: SemanticWeb
* InFer'ence

Concepts: RauSing, MetaMan, BlueMan, TerraMind, AvaTar, BlueMind, PanOrama.
