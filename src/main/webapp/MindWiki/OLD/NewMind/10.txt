The NewMind project is the ReSearch playground of MindBroker for general ArTelligence.

First thoughts and a very first draft of the architecture on top of the MindWiki:

Some concepts are inspired by the OpenCog architecture:
* Memory/storage: The memory consists of probabilistic semantic StateMent's stmt(c,s,p,o),
with a confidence c from [0,1] and a traditional RDF like StateMent (s,p,o).
** The memory has a dedicated root statement.
** the memory contains rules, based on [WikiPedia:Semantic_Web_Rule_Language]
** the memory includes a SemanticWeb wrapper around the MindWiki, and a transitive closure of MindTrust-relationships.

Things that NewMind might do:
* a ChatBot to ask questions to CitiZens
* scutter FoAf-profiles of MindPeople
* fetch their HomePage's and crawl links
* expand and refine TerraMind
* trade shares on the MindFloor
* edit the MindWiki
* build a WortSchatz

The RDF statements are arranged as a causal hierarchy. The engine continuously computes a "root" belief statement, selected from the set of all known resources, based on a HappiNess function.
The NewMind has a representation of itself. It can interact with its environment, if external sources make statements about the NewMind.

Modules:
* Goals:
** an overall HappiNess function
** DoIt: list of possible next actions
** a RoadMap arranging actions into ProJect's
** ReDo: actions to be done RePeat'edly
* PerCeive: MindEyes, MindFeeds, FaceBase, VoiceBase
* Memory:
** EpisodicMemory
** SpatialMemory
** WortSchatz with SemanticWeb-StateMent's
* InFer'ence
* Embodiment: TerraMind

The long-term goal is to achieve an immersive simulation of an entire human MiNd.
It might have a MindApi to the MindEyes of RainerWasserfuhr and other CitiZens.
