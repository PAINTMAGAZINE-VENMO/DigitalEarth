The ultimate abstraction of a VirtualMachine is the TuringMaschine.

Which VirtualMachine architecture will the ArTelligence have?

Probably something like LISP or SmallTalk because of their augmented capabilities of reflection,
especially S-Expressions.

Currently the MindWiki is separated from the SourceCode.
What if the SourceCode would be included in the wiki?

Since NooPolis is OpenSource, it is possible to 
* reflect about the SourceCode at runtime, or even to
* modify SourceCode programmatically

So it could theoretically even SelfImprove recursively.
