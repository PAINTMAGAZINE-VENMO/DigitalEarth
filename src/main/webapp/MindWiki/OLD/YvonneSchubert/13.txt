I am founder and ShareHolder of a software company situated in Dresden. Its name is VebMind. It was found as MindBrokerKg in 1999 and supported by the german ministry of education and scienes. My cofounder was RainerWasserfuhr, a brilliant software developer. 

At the CeBIT 2001 we launched a stock exchange game with two stock markets. The first one was a list of wellknown german politicians, the second market were the five established parties in Germany. By registering at the website the users recieved a virtual fortune. Every user could invest his fortune in the shares of both markets. By bying and selling emerged a trendchart for every share. We encouraged the players by donating a gift to the best player. 

With this prototype we talked to many dozen mediapartners and realized the project together with 4students, the leading german student-portal at this time.

Since 2002 only Rainer Wasserfuhr worked for MindBroker by performing a new consulting business. In this time I finished my studies of german language, german literature and philosophy.

Rainer Wasserfuhr implemented software for SiemensDematic, AdiDas, DeutschePost, TeeSystems and ComBots. With most of these projects successfully with six-digit turnover in 2006. 

Now we are busy to realize several projects in different teams. One of them is a VertikalPortal for individual sport and sportclubs, their teams and members: SportPortal.
