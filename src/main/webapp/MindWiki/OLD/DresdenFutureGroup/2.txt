The DresdenFutureGroup is an informal ThinkTank founded in
2008 at the CityOfDresden by in order to paraphrase the in-TransParent 
FutureGroup of EuropeanUnion. The goal of the DresdenFutureGroup is
to elaborate a detailed landscape of the future CityOfDresden.
We do not want to consume fastfood-futurism a la MatthiasHorx, but 
produce hard-core scenarios and probabilities for our possbile futures.
We operate strictly TransParent'ly: Our invitations, guest lists,
meeting notes (TotalRecall's) and the DresdenFutureWiki will be public 
and published under GnuFdl.

The group was founded by RainerWasserfuhr and seeks for WorldDominance
until the end of the TwentyFirstCentury.

Be prepared to have fun with your future!
