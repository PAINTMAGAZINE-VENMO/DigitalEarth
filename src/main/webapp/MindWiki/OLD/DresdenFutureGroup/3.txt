The DresdenFutureGroup is an informal ThinkTank founded in
2008 in the CityOfDresden. The goal of the DresdenFutureGroup is
to elaborate a detailed landscape of the future CityOfDresden.

We operate strictly TransParent'ly: Our invitations, guest lists,
meeting notes (TotalRecall's) and the DresdenFutureWiki will be public 
and published under GnuFdl.

The group was founded by RainerWasserfuhr and seeks for WorldDominance
until the end of the TwentyFirstCentury.

The philosophy of the group is that of EinfachMachen:
We do not only want be effective by talking, 
but by a mixture of offline- and online activities,
giving the group a permanent TelePresence.


Be prepared to have fun with our future!

!Background
The name of the group paraphrases the in-TransParent FutureGroup of EuropeanUnion, initiated by WolfgangSchaueble.
We do not want to consume fastfood-futurism a la MatthiasHorx, but 
produce hard-core scenarios and probabilities for our possible futures.
