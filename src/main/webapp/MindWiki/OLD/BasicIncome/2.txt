* InterWiki: [WikiPedia:Basic_income]

NooPolis could try new variants of a BasicIncome:

It will include:
* Food
* Shelter
* GeSund'heit
* InterNet connectivity
* a free SocialNetwork account
* MindPost
* MindPhone

It will __not__ include money.
People will not receive money, but services directly.

Therefore the PieschenBank will organise
* MindHome's for ObDach and InterNet
* a daily WarenKorb that CitiZens can obtain from MindPlus
