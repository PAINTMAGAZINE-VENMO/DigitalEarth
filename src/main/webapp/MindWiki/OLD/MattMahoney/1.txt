Some quick 'n dirty thoughts on this paper: http://www.mattmahoney.net/agi.html

As language for this distributed ArTelligence, use SemanticWeb-StateMent's.

Publish statements as XMPP-stream, similar to the TwittEr API.

Instead of questions, use RDF-StateMent's with variables, similar to SPAQRL.
