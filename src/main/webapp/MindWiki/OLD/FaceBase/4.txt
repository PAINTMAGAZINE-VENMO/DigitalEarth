The FaceBase is the set of all known faces of a MiNd,

starting from MamaZwoNull, PapaZwoNull, and up to HalleBerry and KylieMinogue.

What will be the average size of the FaceBase of MindPeople?

Therefore, make the following guesses:
* go to [WikiPedia:May_28], look at "Births" and count the number of people whose face you know, for example KylieMinogue.
* multiply this value by 365
* Go to your favourite SocialNetwork, search for people born on May 28, and count the faces you know
* multiply this value by 365
* estimate the number of people whose faces you know, but not their names.

sum up these values and you will probably have an estimate with a ConFidence of 75%.


Example: The names of MindPeople born on [WikiPedia:May_28] known by RainerWasserfuhr (and the probability that RainerWasserfuhr can tell their name when shown a picture of them):

EdvardBenes (40%), IanFleming (40%), TBoneWalker (30%), HeinzKonsalik (50%), GyorgyLigeti (50%), BuelentEcevit (5%), DietrichFischerDieskau (60%), HorstFrank (70%), RudyGiuliani (60%), JohnFogerty (2%), FrankSchaetzing (40%), KylieMinogue (70%), MikeDiFelice (20%), IanCashmore (2%)

Summing up these probabilities gives ~5 MindPeople for RainerWasserfuhr.
So his entire FaceBase will be approximately 1500 MindPeople covered by WikiPedia.
Probably WikiPedia covers 80% of all celebrities he knows.
Out of his 649 XingLe contacts he will probably recognise 500%.
Let's add 100 people from other SocialNetwork's and 100 people "without names", like the blind beggar living on the crossroad.

So the entire FaceBase of RainerWasserfuhr is 2000 MindPeople with a ConFidence of 80%.
