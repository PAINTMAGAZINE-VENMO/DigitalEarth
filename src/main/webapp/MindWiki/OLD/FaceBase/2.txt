The FaceBase is the set of all known faces of a MiNd,

starting from MamaZwoNull, PapaZwoNull, and up to HalleBerry and KylieMinogue.

What will be the average size of the FaceBase of MindPeople?

Therefore, make the following guesses:
* go to [WikiPedia:May_28], look at "Births" and count the number of people whose face you know, for example KylieMinogue.
* multiply this value with 365
* Go to your favourite SocialNetwork, search for people born on May 28, and count the faces you know
* multiply this value with 365
* estimate the number of people whose faces you know, but not their names.
