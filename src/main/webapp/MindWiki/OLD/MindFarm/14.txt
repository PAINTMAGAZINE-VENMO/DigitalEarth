The MindFarm is a WikiBased BrowserGame for the VirtualEconomy of NooPolis.

Here is how it works:
* The goal of the MindFarm-BrowserGame is to create a realistic digital SystemDynamics model of PlanetEarth, with different parameters, both of ToDay and the rest of the TwentyFirstCentury.
* All CitiZens of NooPolis can play MindFarm.
* Our board is PlanetEarth as you can see [here|http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://noopolis.org/kml]
* you can buy land in the MindShop.

We have a small virtual field: . PlanetEarth is subdivided into Units.
The units have a Latitude and Longitude.

Later on, Units will be subdivided.

Layers:
* L0: entire PlanetEarth (1 unit)
* L1: size of 10 Degrees of latitude and longitude (18x36 units)
