On (TimeLine:20090708)  BarackObama, TaroAso, AngelaMerkel, GordonBrown, NicolasSarkozy, SilvioBerlusconi, StephenHarper and DmitryMedvedev will meet for the GroupOfEightSummit at LaMaddalena,
representing over 860 million people on PlanetEarth. However the most important nation with 1.5 billion CitiZens will not be represented: The InterNet!

Therefore we want to elect the PresidentOfTheUnitedInternet (InternetPresident or PotUi for short) who should
be invited to the next GroupOfEightSummit in July 2010 in HuntsVille.

You can vote for your candidates by tweeting a tweet like "@PresidentVote ..." followed by your candidates
