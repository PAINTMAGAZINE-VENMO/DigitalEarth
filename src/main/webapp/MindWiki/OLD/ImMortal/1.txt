With increasing probability of longevity technologies, it is likely that a social tension will occur between old and young generations.

Longevity is appreciated as a social value. The inevitability of death is an axiom for 99% of the population on PlanetEarth in the year 2008. Even in groups of higher income, better education and healthcare, the group of beliefers in
significant personal longevity will not be much higher.
The ImMortal memes will probably spread in the young generation.
