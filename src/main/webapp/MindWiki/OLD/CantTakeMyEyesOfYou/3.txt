you're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived.
And i thank god i'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

Pardon the way that i stare.
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak.
There are no words left to speak.
But if you feel like i feel.
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I need you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby. trust in me when i say:
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down i pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that i found you, stay.
And let me love you,
Oh baby let me love you
