MindBroker is strongly dedicated to SemanticWeb technologies. We want to help to build the GiantGlobalGraph!

The first steps:

CitiZens who have defined MindTrust on their ProfilePage can export it as FoAf.

Example: [http://id.mindbroker.de/foaf?RainerWasserfuhr]

View with FoafExplorer: [http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http://id.mindbroker.de/foaf?RainerWasserfuhr]

Soon SemanticWeb will help us to build powerful MashUp's and truely open and decentralized SocialNetwork's and even a SemanticEconomy!
