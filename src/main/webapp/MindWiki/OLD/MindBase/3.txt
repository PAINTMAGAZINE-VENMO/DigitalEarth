The MindBase will be a HadoopHBase based database operated on our SocialGrid.

CitiZens will be able to submit MapReduce jobs to the MindBase in order to create new and exciting MashUp's from the DataMap of NooPolis.

how to organise the basic table structure? Some ideas:
* with a very fundamental time series data model (a long as a key class, derived from java.util.Date.getTime() )
* a randomly generated key class, each representing an address of a neuron in a neuro-semantic-network. Basic idea is to approximate neuron activities with highly parallelized MapReduce jobs.
