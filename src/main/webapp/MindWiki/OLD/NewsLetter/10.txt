Dear ***,

This is the first NewsLetter to the CitiZens of NooPolis.
End of March we were 35 CitiZens.

The PieschenBank has opened it's online banking doors.
The account balance of your BankAccount is *** KayGroschen (see http://bank.mindbroker.de/)

We have started to translate the ConStitution to other WorldLanguages.
An initial overview of the current status is available at

  http://www.mindbroker.de/synopsis.

Please let us know if you know someone who wants to help with the translation.

HeikeRibke has worked on the DueckWiki, a wiki for the works of GunterDueck. (GunterDueck has launched BluePedia for EiBiEm.) Heike is looking for additional contributors.

On xx.xx. the first ConsultationHour takes place where
CitiZens and guests are invited to discuss the further development of NooPolis.

From now on this NewsLetter will be sent to all CitiZens once a month.
