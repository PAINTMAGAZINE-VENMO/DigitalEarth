BigTableNomic is a CodeNomic played on top of the functional ProgrammingLanguage CloJure, installed as a WebApp hosted on AppEngine from GoogleInc.

To play BigTableNomic, you should be familiar with
* how a WebApp on the JavaVm and on AppEngine works
* BigTable, as seen through the low level Java DataStore-API
* CloJure, as our main language

BigTableNomic is inspired by PerlNomic, but additionally allows to create very a dynamic and scalable game inventory because of the underlying BigTable InfraStructure.

To JoinNow you only need a GoogleAccount.

For coordinating the BigTableNomic developers we will use a simple "DogFood" application that is based on the BigTable entity "ChatMessage" that is sorted in reverse chronological order by property "date" and shown on the HomePage.

The BootStrap WebApp is at
  http://bigtablenomic.appspot.com/
Other WebApp's based on NoOs can call BootStrap WebApp adownload their initial
version from GoogleCode.

Currently BigTableNomic is played on these AppEngine WebApp's:

BigTableNomic is similar to a WiKi, but here the PageContent is not static text,
but a dynamically executable fragment of SourceCode. 
Currently BigTableNomic supports SourceCode for
* CloJure
* JavaScript (similar to Helma)
* PHP

In TheFuture we might also support server side languages like
* graily
* jRuby
* Jython
* Scala

NoOs wants to help create an ecosystem for programmers, web designers
and users, offering
* Identity
* Trust
* Currency
* SemanticWeb

The LongTerm key purpose of NoOs is to play the AiGame to ArtificialGeneralIntelligence, where you define one or more AvaTar's and play Scenes at the SingularTheater
