BigTableNomic is a CodeNomic played on top of the functional ProgrammingLanguage CloJure, installed as a WebApp hosted on AppEngine from GoogleInc.

To play BigTableNomic, you should be familiar with
* how a WebApp on the JavaVm and on AppEngine works
* BigTable, as seen through the low level Java DataStore-API
* CloJure, as our main language

BigTableNomic is inspired by PerlNomic, but additionally allows to create very a dynamic and scalable game inventory because of the underlying BigTable InfraStructure.

To play BigTableNomic you only need a GoogleAccount. Soon we may also support FbConnect. JoinNow and help to implement it and earn 8192 units of our game currency »KayGroschen«.

For coordinating the BigTableNomic developers we use a simple "DogFood" application that is based on the BigTable entity "BootStrap" that is sorted in reverse chronological order by property "date" and soon shown on the HomePage.

The BootStrap WebApp is at

Other WebApp's based on BigTableNomic obtain their initial version from GoogleCode.

Currently BigTableNomic is played on these AppEngine WebApp's:

BigTableNomic is similar to a WiKi, but here the PageContent is not static text,
but a dynamically executable fragment of SourceCode. 
Currently BigTableNomic supports SourceCode for
* CloJure
* JavaScript (similar to Helma)
* PHP

In TheFuture we might also support server side languages like
* grails
* jRuby
* Jython
* Scala

The mid-term goal of BigTableNomic is to create
a new social OperatingSystem called »NoOs«, offering
* Identity
* Trust
* Currency
* SemanticWeb

We want to help create an ecosystem for programmers, web designers and users.

The LongTerm key purpose of NoOs is to play the AiGame with ArtificialGeneralIntelligence, where you define one or more AvaTar's and play exciting scenes at the SingularTheater.
