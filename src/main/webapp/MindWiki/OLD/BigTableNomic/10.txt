BigTableNomic is a MultiUserGame for SoftWare developers.

It is similar to a WiKi, where you can edit the pages.
But at BigTableNomic you can not only change the WikiPage's,
but you can __change the SourceCode__ of the WikiEngine itself.
So the rules of game can change dynamically, based
on the changes that developers make.
A game that allows to change it's own rules is called »NoMic«.
A game where the rules are coded in SourceCode of a WebApp is called »CodeNomic«.
 
Our CodeNomic game played on top of the functional ProgrammingLanguage CloJure, installed as a WebApp hosted on an AppEngine from GoogleInc.

For coordinating different players, we use a game currency called KayGroschen.

Our VirtualCurrency currently has CurrencyBacking of 1024 EuRo, that will be payed out by
RainerWasserfuhr in cash UnTil 2011-12-31 latest.

To play BigTableNomic, you should be familiar with
* how a WebApp on the JavaVm and on AppEngine works
* BigTable, as seen through the low level Java DataStore-API
* CloJure, as our main language

BigTableNomic is inspired by PerlNomic, but additionally it allows to create very a dynamic and scalable game inventory because of the underlying BigTable InfraStructure.

To play BigTableNomic you only need a GoogleAccount. Soon we may also support FbConnect. JoinNow and help to implement it and earn 8192 units of our game currency »KayGroschen«.

For coordinating the BigTableNomic developers we use a simple "DogFood" application that is based on the BigTable entity "BootStrap" and sorted in ReverseChronological order by property "date" and soon shown on the HomePage.

The BootStrap WebApp is
*  http://bigtablenomic.appspot.com/
Other WebApp's based on BigTableNomic obtain their initial version from GoogleCode.

Currently BigTableNomic is played on these AppEngine WebApp's:
||ReVision||WikiPage||WebApp
|32|BigTableNomic |http://bigtablenomic.appspot.com/
|32|NooPolis      |http://noopolis.appspot.com/
|ToDo|FlavourCity |http://flavourcity.appspot.com/
|ToDo|PieschenArtGroup |http://pieschenartgroup.appspot.com/
|ToDo|PieschenBank|http://pieschenbank.appspot.com/

BigTableNomic is similar to a WiKi, but here the PageContent is not static text,
but a dynamically executable fragment of SourceCode. 
Currently BigTableNomic supports SourceCode for
* CloJure
* JavaScript (similar to Helma)
* PHP

In TheFuture we might also support server side languages like
* grails
* jRuby
* Jython
* Scala

The mid-term goal of BigTableNomic is to create
a new social OperatingSystem called »NoOs«, offering
* Identity
* Trust
* Currency
* SemanticWeb

We want to help create an ecosystem for programmers, web designers and users.
