The NoOs has a BootStrap WebApp called »BigTableNomic« at
  http://bigtablenomic.appspot.com/
Other WebApp's based on NoOs can call NooBootStrap via HtTp download their initial
version.

NoOs is very similar to a WiKi, but the PageContent is not static text,
but dynamically excutable fragments of 
SourceCode. Currently NoOs supports SourceCode for CloJure.

In TheFuture we might also support server side
* JavaScript (similar to Helma)
* jRuby
* PHP
* Jython

NoOs wants to help create an ecosystem for programmers, web designers
and users, offering
* Identity
* Trust
* Currency
* SemanticWeb

The LongTerm key purpose of NoOs is to play the AiGame to ArtificialGeneralIntelligence, where you define one or more AvaTar's and play Scenes at the SingularTheater
