Just imagine a new born baby.

Imagine it lying in front of you on the changing table, while you care about her pampers:

Imagine it to be born with a level of cognitive development that would be equivalent to a professor of computer science.

Now image this baby to grow up. She will be able to 
* remember each article of Wikipedia,
* record each license plate she sees,
* store each single beam of light that touches her retina.
