The DresdenScore is a SemanticWeb quality measure from MindBroker ReSearch for your FoAf node inside the WebOfTrust-enabled GiantGlobalGraph.

How does it work?
* The seed of the NooPolis SocialGraph is the FoAf list of NooPolis CitiZens at http://id.mindbroker.de/citizens
* The DresdenScore scutter recursively checks RDFS:seeAlso links with a breadth-first search strategy
