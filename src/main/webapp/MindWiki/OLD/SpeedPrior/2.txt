For NewMind: randomly generated rules about StateMent's.
Validity of rules is tested by computing limited number of steps,
validated against: A HappiNess function?

NewMind has a temporal memory which is constructed in
analogy to the 43-folders-MetaPhor:
Future actions are organized on a hierarchical temporal horizon.
Predictions are computed against this horizon.

Future actions include state transitions of the WorldModel.

Simplest usecase: sun light on and off every day.

Parallal to this ZeitStrahl there is the semantic level,
constructed from atoms out of the SinnChemie-Baukasten:
Like a TuringMachine, walking on the PageIndex.

So basically the SpeedPrior-programs are hypertexts.
External perception can be simulated by copying texts from
a [AgiriWiki:Sensory_Stimulus].

So the sketch of a basic algorithm for a DigitalTwin:
* start from the HomePage of the real twin, eg RainerWasserfuhr
* list actions on the ReDo page, eg:
** fetch content of HomePage-MindProps
** compare content with PageIndex-atoms
** fetch feeds of MindBlog-MindProps
** compose new page from PageIndex-atoms
** learn MindProps
** create indices on pages
** check if pagename has DelIcioUs links
* learn to act in the external world via http POST: 
** comments
** TwittEr
** creating accounts
