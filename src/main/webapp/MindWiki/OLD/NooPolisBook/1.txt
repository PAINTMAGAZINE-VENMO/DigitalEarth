A BluePrint for a global digital society.

!Summary
NooPolis is an experimental wiki-based MicroNation that wants to create a new currency system based on transparency and a WebOfTrust among it's participants.

In addition to the currency system, NooPolis wants to create an entire political and economic system with elections, legislation, government and GovernmentBudget. Citizens can create startups, that work with OpenBooks.

!Introduction
NooPolis was started by RainerWasserfuhr in 2007 as a ThoughtExperiment.
The initial concept of NooPolis is heavily inspired by NoMic, a game invented by PeterSuber to study "The Paradox of Self-Amendment" (so his book title) in legal systems like constitutions. NooPolis started with a wiki that was by invitation only (building up an initial WebOfTrust). After invitation a wiki user obtains the status of a "Citizen" and can change the Constitution. However each change in the Wiki is versioned together with the RealName of the Citizen. A currency system was established as an incentive for CitiZens. For the RainerWasserfuhr obtained 10% of the initial MoneySupply.
