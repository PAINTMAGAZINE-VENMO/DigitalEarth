Inspired by TeilhardDeCardin, the NooSphere is a never-ending, immersive, ubiquitous, WikiBased massively multiplayer online and alternate reality game to describe the evolution of the future, with a time horizon UnTil2100 and beyond.
It was invented and created by RainerWasserfuhr and MitWirkende and is now on a mission to achieve complete WorldDomination before TheSingularity occurs.

At the center of the NooSphere is NooPolis. It defines the Rules and the players.

Our UniVerse consists of:
* The MindWiki
* The MindMap with hundreds of MindPlace's
* MindPeople, who might not yet be CitiZens of NooPolis
* MindEvent's for ConnectingBeautifulMinds
* EnErgie, which can be taken from a BlackHole and spread across the UniVerse
* The FutureMap with dozens of FutureCard's
* UhTopia
