Inspired by TeilhardDeChardin, the NooSphere is the ProjectCodeName for a WikiBased multiplayer online game to InVent scenarios for the future, with a time horizon UnTil2100 and beyond. You can think of the NooSphere as a SciFi novel, where you can both be an author and actor where you shape your and our future.
The NooSphere was invented and created by RainerWasserfuhr and the CitiZens of NooPolis.

At the center of the NooSphere is NooPolis, our WikiBased digital Republic. It defines the rules (→ ConStitution) and the players (→ CitiZens).

Furthermore our UniVerse consists of:
* The MindWiki
* The MindMap with hundreds of MindPlace's
* MindPeople, who might not yet be CitiZens of NooPolis
* RealLife-MindEvent's for ConnectingBeautifulMinds
* EnErgie, which can be taken from a BlackHole and spread across the UniVerse
* The FutureMap with dozens of FutureCard's
