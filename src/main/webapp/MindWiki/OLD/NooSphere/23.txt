Inspired by TeilhardDeChardin, the NooSphere is a WikiBased multiplayer online RolePlayingGame to InVent scenarios for the TimeToCome, with a time horizon UnTil2100 and beyond. The NooSphere is based on an evolving HardScienceFiction novel, where you can be both an author and actor to shape your and our TimeToCome.
The first player of the NooSphere was RainerWasserfuhr. He started in 2007. He then opened it to other CitiZens.

If you want to play the NooSphere, you should BeBold and not hide yourself in the realms of PriVat'eness.

At the center of the NooSphere is NooPolis, our WikiBased digital MicroNation. It defines the rules (→ ConStitution) and the players (→ CitiZens).

Additionally, our WikiBased UniVerse consists of:
* The MindWiki
* The MindMap with hundreds of MindPlace's
* other MindPeople, who might not yet be CitiZens of NooPolis
* RealLife-MindEvent's for ConnectingBeautifulMinds
* The FutureMap with dozens of FutureCard's, describing advanced scenarios for the TwentyFirstCentury
