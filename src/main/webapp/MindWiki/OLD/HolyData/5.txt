* MindQuote: "Data and why it's good" - PeterNorvig

The more (public!) data the better. Think UpLoad.

"HolyData" is the axiom of a new paradigm towards the NooSphere, which
radicalizes the TheorizingFromData.

It is about WikiBased ConScious'ness.

It is about a spirit which is tolerant about errors
and which favours ReleaseEarlyReleaseOften.

It is about a spirit which is even tolerant about moral errors and
accepts the existence of lower levels of morality in the past (MeaCulpa).

It is about ConScious'ness which never worries to forget, because it has a
perfect history for enabling TotalRecall.
