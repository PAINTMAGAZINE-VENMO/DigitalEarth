On TimeLine:20190922:0815 RainerWasserfuhr woke up in his bed on
the 10th floor of MindTowerZwo.

his MindEyes and walked across the black wooden parquet into WikiTchenTwo.

He wore the latest model of the MindEyes. These magical MindEyes had
a 3D positioning, which allowed RainerWasserfuhr to track his line of sight
in RealTime. When he looked at the AlbertPlatz, little green markers showed 
those people that. Some of them raised their hand and waved to him.
