The WikiWallGame is played by CitiZens of NooPolis via ScreenR, based on our 16x16 board (the WikiWall) which is also physically located at our LockOffice. Each of the 256 WikiWallCard's RePresent's a WikiPage inside our MindWiki. The players choose cards and have to tell a story. They can also choose more than one card and have to find a common ConNect'ion between these WikiWallCard's.
