In the coming weeks and months we want to establish PieschenBank
as a new global game.
At least twice per month, people meet at PensionMorgenstern
in the CityOfDresden to participate in the PieschenArtMuseum, where 
the PieschenArtGroup gives a performance to introduce people to PieschenBank.

The entry point to the game will be http://pieschenbank.de/

We will migrate the existing http://bank.mindbroker.de/ that uses
JavaServerPages and ApacheDerby to the new CloJure and AppEngine
architecture.
