GoMind was concept for a four dimensional Game of Go: x,y,z,t.

The Rules of the Game are defined by the SourceCode of GoMind [here|http://websvn.mindbroker.de/repobrowser.svn?path=%2fde.mindbroker.go%2ftrunk%2f&name=opensource]

Hints:
* the dimensions x,y and z are measured in meter, dimension t is measured in seconds.
* Players should be mavens concerning TuringMaschine's, Goedel-Numberings, Go and NoMic.

The idea is to put pieces of data and code on a four dimensional board.
The goal of the game is to maximize the intellectual pleasure of the players.
GoMind can be an (initially empty) model of the World and it's history and future.

Applications
* OCR of historic city maps like [this one|http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Dresden_Map_1895.jpg]

GoMind is now superseded by the TerraMind VirtualMachine of the AiGame.
