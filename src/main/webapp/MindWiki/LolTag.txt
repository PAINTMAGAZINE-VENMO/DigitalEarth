On september 2004 RainerWasserfuhr started to collect funny links at DelIcioUs under http://del.icio.us/rainer/lol. When historians of the TwentyFirstCentury will look at this, they will notice, that an increasing percentage of his laughing was taking place online. When he laughed before 2004, it could only be heard by the people near by. An ever increasing ratio of his laughing after 2004 had an echo chamber which potentially had a global reach.
