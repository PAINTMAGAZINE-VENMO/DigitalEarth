Idea: SubMit a MindPaper to IsWc 2010:

!DcTitle: SemanticMind - A SemanticWeb based personal LifeWiki on the long road towards WholeBrainEmulation ;)

The SemanticMind will be a SemanticWeb based Model of the personal KnowLedge of RainerWasserfuhr.

It consists of concrete entities like places, books, ideas, PerSon's or general ConCept's like »NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness«.

It is created from a public LifeWiki started end of 2006 that grew to a PageCount of over 10.000 WikiPage's UnTil january 2010.

This MindPaper describes how the data is created, maintained, embedded into LinkedData and possible applications for the TimeToCome.

!A SemanticWiki

The ConTent is created and maintained by a slightly modified JspWiki.
Each ReSource is first created as a WikiPage.
The PageIndex of all WikiPage's is the base for all DeFin'ed ReSource's.
Each WikiPage can be hooked into an OntoLogy via MindProps.
40% of the WikiPage's are sorted into a lightweight OntoLogy with a "SubClassOf"-depth of 1 to 5 levels.

!The data
The RdF will soon be available as
* MindN3
* MindRdf

This paper gives an introduction to the SemanticMind project, which is a long term approach
to apply SemanticWeb technologies for modelling the knowledge of a single human brain and mind.

!Background
Cognitive sciences are going to become a dominant role in the coming decades.
The BlueBrain by HenryMarkram EtAl estimates to have a functional simulation of the physiological 
processes in the human brain until 2019 [*|http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8164060.stm].

Capturing the ConTent of a single human brain is a ComPlex and ambitious endeavour, whose just 
activities started and strongly depend on technologies availiable and the NearerstFuture.
WilliamSimsBainbridge developed questionnaires
for "PersonalityCapture" [*|http://ssc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/3/267].

According to RayKurzweil, the resolution of brain scanning technologies seems to be advancing
at an exponential rate.

But a working model of a real human, which is capable to
to serve as a simulation in VirtualReality settings,
should be in the reach during the next 15 to 25 years.

A special focus of the ProJect in the first phases is on capturing the KnowLedge about
PerSon's. A good portion of this can nowadays be done by evaluating and restructuring
the data in MailBox'es FaceBook, TwittEr etc.

The ReSearch in this domain is influenced by the PriVat'eness of affected PerSon's.

Therefore the has a so called GiftSchrank (GermanLanguage for poison cabinet).

So to create the world famous people of CommonSense KwowLedge (like JesusChrist, BarackObama or KarlMarx)
down to the friendly salesgirl without a name in the bakery next door.

Mapping RdF triples to neurons.

The SemanticMind projects aims at the description

SemanticMind started 2007.

Other related approaches:
* JerryMichalski maintains a public based on the SoftWare TheBrain.
* BillSeitz with his WikiLog

(February 2010)
PageCount of 10666 WikiPage's.

The averary number of edits ranges from 1 to almost 500 ReVision's per WikiPage.


For example, the taxonomy of apples inside WikiPedia is:
* Malus
* Category:Maleae
* Category:Maloideae
* Category:Rosaceae
* Category:Rosales
* Category:Rosids
* Category:Core_eudicots
* Category:Eudicots
* Category:Angiosperms
* Category:Plants
* Category:Eukaryotes
* Category:Organisms

Except maybe Plants, Eukaryotes and Organisms, neither of these terms is contained in the TreasuryOfWords
of a PerSon with average academic education, except she is specializid in the field of systematic biology. 

This might be a, but does not represent the
that are necessary to reason about apples in everyday life.


As of january 2010, 88 other PerSon's have 
editing permissions for the MindWiki.
In this sense, the MindWiki functions like WikiBased InBox

!The cognitive graph

The metaphor of mathematical graph has achieved some popularization . 
SocialGraph for describing the relationship and across SocialNetwork's.

In TimBernersLee coined the concept of the GiantGlobalGraph as 
an anticipation of the emerging InternetOfThings.

Brain with it's 100 billion neurons and on average 1000 synaptical connections.


CognitiveGraph.

In the SemanticMind project, the 

Thinking as graph 

Anticipating future technological progress in

The SemanticMind as LinkedData

Changing the social environment towards cognitive.

DelicioUs


The RdF itself is generated as NotationThree via CloJure code inside the MindWiki: RdfClj

!LinkedData
One of the InterWiki-links to WikiPedia and LifeWiki's WikiWikiWeb of WardCunningham or CommunityWiki.
Since 2009 many PerSon's working as ReSearch'ers in ComputerScience also obtained DeepLink's to DbLp.

The raw ConTent of the MindWiki is also available for DownLoad as MindZip.

!From a PersonalWiki to a GroupWiki
We opened up the MindWiki for additional users by invitation. The MindWiki has a strict RealName policy
to ensure a high data quality and a UniqueNameAssumption.
This means that each for ReSource of the PageIndex we can issue a OwL-DifferentFrom assurance.

!From a GroupWiki to an EnterpriseWiki
In March 2009 RainerWasserfuhr teamed up with RalfLippold to apply SemanticWiki technology
for a new StartUp called LockSchuppenAg.

The LockSchuppen is an AmbItio'us ProJect to renovate a former RoundHouse in the CityOfDresden 
and create a ThinkAndDoTank about new ways of CoWorking and CoLiving 
towards TheSingularity. The entire StartUp phase of LockSchuppenAg was managed
by the MindWiki, including the ConTract of the ShareHolder's and the LockSchuppenBusinessPlan.
