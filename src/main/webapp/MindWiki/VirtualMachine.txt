The ultimate abstraction of a VirtualMachine is the TuringMaschine.

Which VirtualMachine architecture will the ArTelligence have?

Probably something like LISP or SmallTalk because of their augmented capabilities of reflection,
especially S-Expressions.

Initially the MindWiki was separated from the SourceCode.
Since NooMic the SourceCode is more and more included in the MindWiki

Since NooPolis is OpenSource, it is possible to 
* reflect about the SourceCode at runtime, or even to
* modify SourceCode programmatically

So it could theoretically even SelfImprove recursively.
