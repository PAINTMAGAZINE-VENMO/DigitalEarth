* DeFine: A WikiPage of the MindWiki can have MindProps, which can be mapped to an RdfProperty

Example: MindProps »BirthDay« map to the FoAf RdfProperty: »http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#birthday«

Each RdfProperty forces a certain logic like type consistency on the PageContent, which can be validated via InFer'ence.
