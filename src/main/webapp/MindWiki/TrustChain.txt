NooPolis is designed as a true WebOfTrust.

Each activity of CitiZens (e.g. editing the MindWiki, including the ConStitution and the GovernmentBudget of NooPolis)
can be traced back to a root TrustChain.

At the beginning, the TrustChain was created by RainerWasserfuhr (as MindOne).

In the future, the TrustChain might evolve into a mechanism which is independent of a single person,
e.g. to a CabiNet.

When a citizen trust to another citizen, they also accept the VerAntwortung
in the case that the trusted person misuses his trust and his FreeDom.
