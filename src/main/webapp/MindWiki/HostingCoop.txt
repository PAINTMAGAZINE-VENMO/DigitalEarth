Idea: Build a hosting CoOp where you can store __all__ your personal data on a server of our SocialGrid, including:
* OpenId-based spam-free mail
* your personal Blog
* your Jabber based personal instant messaging server
* your foto gallery
* your personal wiki - interlinked with wikis of your friends via InterWiki
