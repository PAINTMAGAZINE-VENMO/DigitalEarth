if "ToGoogle" was a VerbOfTheYear once ago, "ToLeak" could be the current one.
At first sight, "ToLeak" might seem like a gesture of aggression, 
is not really a surprise, when seen through more AbsTra'ct glasses:
If "Truth" is an evolutionary attractor, that points towards the NooSphere,

"the emperor is naked" - so is the modern corporate knowledge
cultures that were framed around "IntellectualProperty", "FireWall" with 
"SmartFilter" and NonDisclosureAgreement.
