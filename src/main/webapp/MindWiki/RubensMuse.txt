The most difficult word: "G{a|e|o}m{b|h}{o|e}tta"

"Ru..." suggested to be "Rue". So it looked like France.

"...menade..." was Promenade.

Additionally, there was a beach in the lower part of
the picture. Combined with the compass on the upper left
of the picture, the Promenade was on a beach in the south.

With the two keywords "Gambetta" and "Promenade", you could google yourself
to Nice: 
You landed at the corner of BoulevardGambetta
and PromenadeDesAnglais.
Visiting this MindPlace with StreetView you
quickly see the Restaurant Chantecler.
