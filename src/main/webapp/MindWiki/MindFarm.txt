The MindFarm is a WikiBased BrowserGame for BootStrap'ping the VirtualEconomy of NooPolis.

Here is how it works:
* The goal of the MindFarm-BrowserGame is to create a realistic digital SystemDynamics model of PlanetEarth, with different parameters, both of ToDay and the remaining TwentyFirstCentury.
* All CitiZens of NooPolis can play MindFarm (JoinNow).
* Our board is PlanetEarth as you can see [here|http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://noopolis.org/kml]
* you can buy land in the MindShop.

We have a virtual field: PlanetEarth is subdivided into WorldUnit's. Each CitiZen can own one or more units. The units have a BoundingBox with latitude and longitude.

The name of each unit is displayed on the WorldMap, e.g.:
* WorldUnitL1W120N30 (SanFrancisco)
* WorldUnitL1W70N40 (NewYork)
* WorldUnitL1E10N50 (FrankFurt)
* WorldUnitL1E10S30 (CapeTown)
* WorldUnitL1E130N30 (ToKyo)
etc

Later on, Units will be subdivided into more detailed layers:
* L0: entire PlanetEarth (1 unit)
* L1: size of 10 Degrees of latitude and longitude (18x36 units)
* L2: 1 Degree (10x10 units)
* L3: 0.1 Degrees
* L4: 0.01 Degrees
* L5: 0.001 Degrees
* L6: 0.0001 Degrees

On the first level of the MindFarm BrowserGame, you can buy L1-Units.

The owner of a unit has to create as much as possible true facts about his unit.
Other players can challenge the owner by a MindVote on a fact.

We will start with the following facts:
* MindCount - number of real people living inside the unit.
* WaterHandICap - percentage of water surface of the unit.
* EnErgie - average EnErgie produced on the unit (in Watt).
* CalculationsPerSecond - average sum of calculations of all PCs and LapTop's (according to LinPack)
* CarCount - in total numbers
* ElectroCarCount - in total numbers
* BikeCount - in total numbers
* PlaneCount - in total numbers (on average located inside the unit)
* ConTainer - sum of 20ft and 40ft containers in TwentyFootEquivalentUnit's

Allowed moves:
* Buy a land unit in the MindShop
* edit MindProps of the Unit
* edit the Rules
* challenge a co-player on a fact
* vote on a fact
