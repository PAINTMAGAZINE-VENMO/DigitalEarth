* InterWiki: [WikiPedia:Telepresence]

It does not matter where you are as long as you have a MindWiki, TwittEr, a MindChat and a StaatsFunk like PieschenTv

Aspects of TelePresence:
* Connectivity: You need InterNet connectivity
* Travelling: no more.
* Office space: shrinked to zero. You can work from your BettQuarters, your WikiTchen or your NichtRaucherBalkon
* Odor: You can't smell other people. This may be an advantage or disadvantage
* Health: Your team becomes resistant to pandemics like NoRo
* Learning: If you grew up in a non-TelePresence culture you have to learn to master TelePresence tools.

Tools:
* WorldWideWeb
* SkyPe
* SeesMic
* FlickEr
* TwittEr
