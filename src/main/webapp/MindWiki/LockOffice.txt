The LockOffice was the first interim office of LockSchuppenAg at LouisenStrasse in the NeuStadt of the CityOfDresden from 2009-11 to 2010-04.

The LockOffice was a connecting hub, where EntrePreneur's, DeSign'ers, ProGram'mers, ReSearch'er, Politicians and other people interested in collaborative ways of working have meet for dozens of LockSession's.

At the ZukunftsRaum we operated a first FutureLab2056 showcase where we developed LongTerm scenarios for the TwentyFirstCentury, which were a StartingPoint of the SingularAcademy.

Our ~25 sqm LockAgora was a facility for WorkShop's and CoLearning (web and IT tools making collaborative work more effective and relaxing).

We also offered an experimental CoWorkingSpace for EntrePreneur's and FreeLancer.
