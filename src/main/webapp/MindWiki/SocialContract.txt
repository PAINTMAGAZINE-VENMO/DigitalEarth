A fundamental idea of NooPolis is the SocialContract between
it's CitiZens.

We create the SocialContract on a PeerToPeer base, from scratch, or from: a WikiBased TabulaRasa.

We do not know whether our WebOfTrust will scale beyond the current level.
We start the SocialContract from
* different economic levels, with
* different languages,
* diffent skills.

The basic challenge of the SocialContract:
* If two (or more) people come together, can they co-ordinate their actions, 
including all future risks of contract breaches, based on a rational agreement, without 
reference to an external power?
