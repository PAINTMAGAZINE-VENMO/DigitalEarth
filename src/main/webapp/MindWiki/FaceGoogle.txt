April 1st, 2011:
* LarryPage: Hello MarkZuckerberg.
* MarkZuckerberg:  Hello LarryAndSergey.
* SergeyBrin: Hello MarkZuckerberg... how is PeterThiel?
* PeterThiel: Hello SergeyBrin, are MarissaMayer and EricSchmidt with you?
* EricSchmidt: Hello FaceBook, here we are, so let's start. What's your MarketCap? Our current StockPrice is 512 UsDollar, so we are at 162 440 000 000 UsDollar.
* PeterThiel: Our MarketCap is 15 000 000 000 UsDollar.
* EricSchmidt: Ouch... 
* PeterThiel: We will be able to roll out our FaceDollar project next month: A global currency for a then estimated UserBase of 500 000 000 active MonthlyActiveUser.
* LarryPage: You are too late. WaveCash is currently taking off. 1 WaveCoin is already at 128 UsDollar.
* SergeyBrin: Please let's first talk about the technical issues: How shall we merge our UserBase's?
* MarkZuckerberg: Please tell us first about your legendary InfraStructure. Where is UrsHoelzle?
* UrsHoelzle: Currently we have 2.097.152 commodity server nodes, which we are doubling every 18 months. They are spread across 16 DataCenter's and consume nearly 1% of the WorldEnergy.
* PeterThiel: Please, guys, let's focus on our competitors first.
* MarissaMayer: *clears her throat*... TwittEr? ;) ... @ev, are you there?
* EvanWilliams: Hi followers: What do you think how we fixed our performance ProBlem's...? I hope the WorldWideWeb foundation will  forgive us, but we had to slaughter the FailWhale on a BigTable... GoogleInc is now hosting our more than 8.589.934.592 tweets.
* PeterThiel: We already outpaced one of our foremost competitors at end of 2009, when our UserBase surpassed the 308.241.000 CitiZens of the UnitedStates.
* EricSchmidt: So what about your plans for the UnitedSemanticNations?
* MarkZuckerberg: One moment, let me just write on the Wall of our ChiefSemanticOfficer...
* TimBl: Hello SemanticWorld. I just got stuck in the GiantGlobalGraph with my FbId 512908782. Of course my main concern is how to build a WebOfTrust for the joined SocialGraph of FaceBook and GoogleInc.
* PeterThiel: So with FaceBook and GoogleMail combined we have a UserBase 700 000 000 of CitiZens on PlanetErde.
* TimBl: We just have to define some SameAs-relationships between the profiles.
* PeterThiel: Next we need some kind of legislative mechanisms that can replace nation state
voting procedures.
* MarissaMayer: How can we avoid a SystemClash with existing NationState's?
* PeterThiel: We will just scale the UnitedSemanticNations slowly and show them the unrivaled power of a global, selforganized political system that is based on a WebOfTrust, RadiCal TransParency and a global MindId for 600 000 000 CitiZens on PlanetErde, growing with an monthly rate of 5%.
* SergeyBrin: @PeterThiel so you are informed about ProJect 20080209234?
* PeterThiel: Of course ;) - That's why i donated yet another 115 000 000 UsDollar to the SeaSteading institute to build the first ClubStead ;).
* MarissaMayer: How can we address the PostPrivacy issues that the establishment of existing NationState's can instrumentalize against us? noone would accept a public voting and currency system at this time?
* MarkZuckerberg: first we have to capture ThiloWeichert and arrest him on the ClubStead ;)
* EricSchmidt: How can we foresee the with this step we will AcCelerate.
* MarkZuckerberg: Should we ask our ChiefSingularityOfficer?
* RayKurzweil: HelloWorld, the SingularityIsNear ;)
* LarryAndSergey in choir: Hi RayKurzweil- you here??? You are our ChiefSingularityOfficer too... why didn't you tell us that you are working for our strongest competitor?
